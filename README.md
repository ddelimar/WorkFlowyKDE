WorkFlowyKDE
============

A simple browser window into [workflowy.com](https://workflowy.com/?ref=14da4ba8) web app for KDE enviroinment.

WorkFlowy is an organizational tool that helps you organize personal to-dos, collaborate on large team projects, take notes, write research papers, keep a journal, plan a wedding, and much more.

##Caveats
Currently, this app is *really* simple. So simple, it won't keep you logged in after you restart it.

##Setup
At the current stage, what you can use is pretty much just the python script at contents/code/workflowy.py. You can copy it into /usr/local/bin/ or wherever you want, make it executable:

	chmod a+x workflowy.py

and run it by calling:

	python workflowy.py

from your command line.[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/8ac07c556bd1ee0171042e9036383721 "githalytics.com")](http://githalytics.com/ddelimar/WorkFlowyKDE)
